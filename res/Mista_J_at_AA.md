Mista J at AA
-------------

At an AA meeting held in a decently sized basement room in a convention center somewhere, a sober man in a purple suit took his turn at the podium.  He took off his hat and set it there in front of him before speaking.  The understanding crowd gave no reaction to his green hair or his odd looking face.  Who were they to judge?

"My name is John..." he began, adding, "Jacob," after a slight pause. Away from the microphone he muttered, "Jingleheimer Shmidt".

"Hi, Jon Jacob," replied the crowd, without judgment.

"And I am..." he paused again, "_not_ an alcoholic.  Never touch the stuff.  I like _me_ too much as I am!"

This statement provoked _a little_ judgment.  Grumbles from the crowd prompted a snap of the speaker's fingers, the immediate result being the arrival of strangely costumed men strolling in and brandishing Tommy guns.

"Now, now! _I_ listened to _you_ when it was _your_ turn to speak!"

The crowd settled into a nervous silence.

"As I was saying, alcohol just isn't my thing. But you guys... you guys are _fun_ drunks!  The stories you tell!  The beatings of loved ones!  The destruction of private property!  The criminal acts you can blame on the drink and then just... go to a meeting!" He gave a sweeping look over crowd before continuing. "The things you guys admit to up here come ___so close___ to being _proper_ entertainment! But... you've got this whole... _downer_ vibe.  Thankfully, I've come to help."

For a moment, he looked as though he were waiting for the crowd to cheer, but only extremely sober and frightened faces were to be found staring back at him.

"How, you might ask?  First, let me ask _you_ a question.  Do you have _any_ idea how difficult it is to aerosolize the effects of alcohol?  You can't just vaporize whiskey and expect the same results.  I know!  My boys," he grinned evilly, "back at the lab... have really done their research!"

It was then that some of the costumed men began rolling several large tanks into the room. They looked like Helium tanks for inflating baloons.

"Anyway, I'm here to tell you... that you don't _need_ help!" he said, pointing around the room, "What you all need, is a ___good stiff drink!___  And ___this one___ is on the house!"

The hissing release of a green gas coming from the tanks shocked the crowd! The costumed men were quick to remind the crowd that it was rude to be disruptive while someone was speaking by firing several rounds from their machine guns into the ceiling. Many hadn't noticed the the three and a half foot high henchman deliver an object to just behind the podium. The speaker reached down for this item now. It was a mask connected with a tube to a small tank.  He pressed it to his face and inhaled through it before speaking again.

"This stuff you're breathing in, provided you're not too keen on suffocation, is going to put so much hair on your chest you'll think you've taken 2 evolutionary steps backward!  You'll Karaoke harder than all of Tokyo on any given night!  You will run over every mailbox and postman between Santa Monica and Queems! You will turn this city into the biggest bar fight this side of the Rio Grande!"

He paused again, breathing from the mask.

"And when I come back," he spoke now with quickness and anger, "I expect to hear stories of such drunken depravity and meaningless violence that I ___wet myself___ in a ___fit of giggles!___"  The anger switched seemlessly to wicked laughter after the briefest of pauses, like an uncle who thinks his dirty jokes are much funnier than does the nephew trying to ignore his uncle's whiskey breath.

He put the mask back to his face and managed to calm a bit before taking his leave of the podium and strolling happily down the aisle.  He turned his head back to the crowd, who were all beginning to relax, and, with a tip of his hat, he said, "Toodaloo!", just before heading out the double doors at the back of the room.
