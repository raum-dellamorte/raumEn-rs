Mista J at AA
-------------

At an AA meeting held in a decently sized basement room in a convention center somewhere a sober man in a purple suit took his turn at the podium.  He took off his hat and set it there in front of him before speaking.  The understanding crowd gave no reaction to his green hair or his odd looking face.  Who were they to judge?

"My name is John..." he began, adding, "Jacob," after a slight pause. Away from the microphone he muttered, "Jingleheimer Shmidt".

"Hi, Jon Jacob," replied the crowd, without judgment.

"And I am..." he paused again, "_not_ an alcoholic.  Never touch the stuff.  I like _me_ too much as I am!"

This statement provoked a little judgment.  Grumbles from the crowd prompted a snap of the speakers fingers followed by the appearance of men in strange costumes with machine guns.

"Now, now! _I_ listened to _you_ when it was _your_ turn to speak!"

The crowd settled into a nervous silence.

"As I was saying, it just isn't my thing, but you guys... you guys are _fun_ drunks!  The stories you tell!  The beatings of loved ones!  The destruction of private property!  The criminal acts you can blame on the drink and then just... go to a meeting!  The things you guys admit to up here come so close to being proper entertainment, but... you've got this whole... _downer_ vibe.  Thankfully, I've come to help."

He took a moment to eye the crowd before continuing.  Extremely sober faces stared right back at him.

"How, you might ask?  First, let me ask _you_ a question.  Do you have _any_ idea how difficult it is to aerosolize the effects of alcohol?  You can't just vaporize whiskey and expect the same results.  I know!  My boys," he grinned evilly, "back at the lab... have really done their research!"

More costumed men began rolling several large tanks into the room.

"Anyway, I'm here to tell you that... you don't _need_ help!" he said, pointing around the room, "What you all need is a ___good stiff drink!___  And ___this one___ is on the house!"

The hiss of a clear gas being released from the tanks shocked several of the attending but the costumed men were quick to remind them that it was rude to be disruptive while someone was speaking by shooting up the ceiling a little.  The speaker pulled out a mask that fit perfectly over his nose and mouth and was connected via a clear plastic tube to a small tank hidden behind the podium.  He inhaled through it what was probably regular air before speaking again.

"This stuff you're breathing in, provided you're not too keen on suffocation, is gonna put so much hair on your chest you'll think you've taken 2 evolutionary steps backward!  You'll Karaoke harder than all of Tokyo any given night!  You will turn this city into the biggest bar fight this side of the Rio Grande!"

He paused again to breath from the mask.

"And when I come back," he spoke now with quickness and anger, "I expect to hear stories of such drunken depravity and meaningless violence that I ___wet myself___ in a ___fit of giggles!___"  The anger switched to wicked laughter after the briefest of pauses like an uncle who thinks his dirty jokes are much funnier than does the nephew trying to ignore his uncle's whiskey breath.

He put the mask back to his face and managed to calm a bit before walking out from behind the podium and straight down the aisle.  He turned and said, "Toodaloo!", just before heading out the front entrance.
